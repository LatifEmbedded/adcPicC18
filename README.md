### ADC Programming:
An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is a device responsible for converting analog signals to digital signals, allowing the CPU to process this information. 
This repository contains instructions on how to program an ADC using both C and assembly languages.
Modern microcontrollers often have built-in ADC modules to reduce the number of pins required for other applications. 
The PIC18F352 microcontroller, for example, features 8 analog input channels and a 10-bit resolution.
