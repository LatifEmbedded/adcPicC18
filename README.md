### ADC PROGRAMMING : 
ADC PERIPHERAL FOR CONVERTING ANALOG SIGNALS TO DIGITAL SIGNALS
mainCode.c source file uses polling 
adcInterrupt.c source file uses interrupt
the PIC18F452 has an adc module of 10 bit resolution with 8 analog channalers capable of converting differenting physical quantities
### NOTE :
Using Proteus and Picsimlab to view the output and MPLAB IDE + C18 compiler in order to programme the adc
